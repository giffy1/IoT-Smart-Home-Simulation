To run the tests, make sure to run FIRST the gateway AND THEN the backend. Then you can run a test. What I do is open a tab, type the command "python gateway.py". Then open another tab, use command "python backend.py". Then open a final tab and run whichever test. When starting a new test, I always kill all clients first, then kill and restart the server, because of indexing artifacts that occur when keeping the same server running (sorry about that!). When running any of these scripts, you can add the flag -f to suppress debugging output. I'd definitely recommend doing that when running the tests. Specifically you should run tests for example as follows: "python test_sync -f". This will only show the relevant output.
